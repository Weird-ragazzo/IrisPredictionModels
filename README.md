## 🔍 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use different ML classifiers to predict the species of Iris flowers based on user-input features:

- 🌸 **Logistic Regression**
- 🌺 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- 🌷 **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- 🌳 **Decision Tree**

Each model is trained using Scikit-learn and saved using `joblib`. The two apps allow users to select a model, enter feature values, and receive predictions along with confidence scores and visualizations.
